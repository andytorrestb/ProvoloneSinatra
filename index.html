      If you care enough to learn some more about the back story of the humble dude:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Cavin Bryce has always been obsessed with literature. As a child he spent all available time reading, often bouncing between encyclopedias covering various animal species to fiction. He’s always held a special place in his heart for science and often fantasized as a child about the future of medical technology, space exploration, etc. Today, this infatuation with the natural, scientific, world shows up often in his writing. Despite his- uhhh- modest(?) size and generally nonathletic build he played a variety of sports from age four up until he was fifteen. These include baseball, football, wrestling, basketball, and competing in Brazilian Jiu-Jetsu. He fell away from his athletic roots to pursue art and spent his entire high school career focusing on painting and graphic design. Through a network of friends he eventually came to know a gentle, beautiful, soul named Kyle Hiden. On the night that they held their first independent conversation from their group, the two teenagers drunkenly discussed a film that Kyle dreamed of producing. Having been noticed for his writing ability by several teachers, Cavin offered his help. They worked on the script until the sun came up, and it was realized that the experience was entirely invigorating for the both of them. The two had a slight fall from grace and were unable to complete the script, or the film. Cavin applied to UCF with no real idea of what he was going to do, only knowing that he wanted to create. Three years later he has found himself here, knee deep in ink, in love with with working on his writing.

      “These short stories are absolutely enchanting; they're written beautifully, 
      allowing readers to digest each situation with ease. Sinatra's characterization is immaculate…”

     “From the start it is very abrasive, but also engaging enough to keep you reading.
      Overall, the interesting characters and the subtle, sarcastic humor laced through
      out make it a very entertaining read. Just wish it was longer.”

     “At the beginning I was a little unsure of how the style of this book was going to 
      go, but I ended up enjoying how the author divided the book into multiple stories, 
      characters, and subjects.”
